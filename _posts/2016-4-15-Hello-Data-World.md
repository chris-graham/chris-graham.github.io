## 10 Weeks to go!

If you're reading this, you probably already know something about the Data Science Boot Camp at Metis or tech boot camp's in general. I'd like to confirm, for anyone who's wondering, that the Boot Camp moniker could not be more accurate. The last 2 weeks has felt like trying to drink from a firehose. I can't think of many times in my professional life where I've been more overwhelmed and none where I've been in that state for 3 straight months. On the positive side, I'm overwhelmed with topics I want to learn, so it's feels a lot different from having to comlete a bunch of TPS reports at a job you don't love! By far, the best parts of the program are my fellow students and the patient instructors. I can't wait to move through the next 10 weeks, but I know I'll be sad when it's over.

## Technologies through week 2
Here's a list of technologies we've covered to date:
* python (obviously)
* pandas
