## 10 Weeks to go!

If you're reading this, you probably already know something about the Data Science Boot Camp at Metis or tech boot camp's in general. I'd like to confirm for anyone who's wondering that the Boot Camp moniker could not be more accurate. The last 2 weeks has felt like trying to drink from a firehose. I can't think of many times in my professional life where I've been more overwhelmed and none where I've been in that state for 3 straight months. On the positive side, I'm overwhelmed with topics I want to learn, so it's feels a lot different from being overwhelmed at a job where you have to comlete a bunch of TPS reports on the weekend! 

## Boot Camp Work

### Pair Programming
We start every day with a coding challenge that we attempt with a partner. It's usually a small problem that illustrates a topic covered in the previous day. I typically have to stare at the problem for 5 minutes before I can figure out the first step to sovling it. It's very rewarding 

### Challenges
Challenges are a set of small problems that focus on building skills needed to complete your projects. They range from trying to teach you a Python package like Pandas to statistical concepts like Ordinary Least Squares.
### Projects
We completed our first project last Friday which involved taking MTA turnstile data and
